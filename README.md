# Geofencing

This is an example script that shows how to implement geofencing using OpenLayers v4 and OpenStreetMap.

It also shows how one might use closures to write functions that will only be called once - useful when building adventures ;)


## Polygon Selection

The ```polygon_selection``` script is a great tool for easily selecting polygons for use in geofencing.
